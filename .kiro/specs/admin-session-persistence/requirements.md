# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current WebSocket server implementation assigns a new admin socket ID every time an admin connects, preventing them from managing sessions they created in previous connections. This creates a significant usability issue where admins lose control over their sessions after network disconnections or application restarts. This feature will implement persistent admin authentication that allows admins to reconnect and regain control of their previously created sessions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to authenticate with persistent credentials so that I can be recognized across multiple connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin connects to the WebSocket server THEN the system SHALL authenticate them using persistent credentials (username/password or token)
2. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL assign a persistent admin identifier that remains consistent across connections
3. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL reject the connection with an appropriate error message
4. WHEN an admin reconnects with valid credentials THEN the system SHALL recognize them as the same admin user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to regain control of sessions I created in previous connections so that I can manage them after reconnecting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated admin reconnects THEN the system SHALL identify all sessions they previously created
2. WHEN an admin requests to manage a session THEN the system SHALL verify they are the original creator before allowing access
3. WHEN an admin successfully reconnects THEN the system SHALL update the session's current admin socket ID while preserving the original admin identity
4. IF an admin tries to manage a session they didn't create THEN the system SHALL deny access with an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the system to handle multiple concurrent admin connections gracefully so that I can connect from different devices or browser tabs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the same admin connects from multiple devices THEN the system SHALL allow multiple concurrent connections for the same admin identity
2. WHEN multiple connections exist for the same admin THEN any of them SHALL be able to manage sessions created by that admin identity
3. WHEN an admin performs an action from one connection THEN other connections for the same admin SHALL be notified of the change
4. WHEN an admin disconnects from one device THEN sessions SHALL remain accessible from other active connections for the same admin
5. WHEN different admins attempt to manage each other's sessions THEN the system SHALL prevent the action and enforce ownership boundaries

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want session ownership to be clearly tracked and displayed so that I can understand which sessions I can manage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN listing sessions THEN the system SHALL show all sessions with clear ownership indicators
2. WHEN displaying session details THEN the system SHALL show the admin identity who created the session
3. WHEN an admin attempts an unauthorized management action THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about ownership requirements
4. WHEN multiple admins exist THEN each SHALL be able to view all sessions but only manage their own sessions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to view and monitor sessions created by other admins so that I can provide support and maintain system oversight.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN listing sessions THEN the system SHALL display all active sessions regardless of which admin created them
2. WHEN viewing session details THEN the system SHALL allow read-only access to sessions created by other admins
3. WHEN attempting to modify another admin's session THEN the system SHALL prevent the action and indicate it requires ownership
4. WHEN viewing another admin's session THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the session is read-only
5. WHEN multiple connections of the same admin exist THEN all connections SHALL be able to manage that admin's sessions but NOT sessions owned by different admins

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want admin authentication to be secure and configurable so that unauthorized users cannot gain admin access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN admin authentication is enabled THEN the system SHALL require valid credentials for all admin operations
2. WHEN invalid credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL log the authentication attempt and reject access
3. WHEN admin credentials are configured THEN they SHALL be stored securely and not exposed in logs or responses
4. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL generate secure JWT secrets and enforce token-based authentication
