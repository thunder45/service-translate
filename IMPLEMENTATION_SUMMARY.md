- [ ] Troubleshooting guides

## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install dependencies
cd src/backend
npm install

# Install CDK globally
npm install -g aws-cdk
```

### Deploy
```bash
# Bootstrap (first time only)
cdk bootstrap

# Deploy stack
npm run deploy
```

### Post-Deployment
1. Note the WebSocket URL from outputs
2. Create admin user in Cognito
3. Configure client applications with endpoint

## Key Differences from Old Implementation

1. **Connection Parameters**: Now in query string, not request body
2. **Environment Variables**: Use `https://` format (clients convert to `wss://`)
3. **Audio Config**: Passed in `startsession` body, not connection
4. **Timestamps**: Required in all messages
5. **Session Reconnection**: Admin can rejoin paused sessions
6. **Error Format**: Standardized with type, code, message, details

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Build web client application for congregation members
2. **Short-term**: Add comprehensive testing suite
3. **Medium-term**: Add monitoring, analytics, and optimization
4. **Long-term**: Mobile apps and advanced features
5. ✅ **Completed**: WebSocket server connections now authenticated for admin primitives
6. ✅ **Completed**: Session list refreshes automatically on admin reconnection
7. **Future**: Add support for male speakers in TTS
8. ✅ **Completed**: Admin reconnection properly handles session recovery
9. **Future**: Reduce the retry on WebSocket connection error to only 2 times

## Notes

- All Lambda handlers are fully implemented with real AWS service integrations
- Infrastructure is production-ready with proper security and monitoring hooks
- **Audio processing uses real AWS Transcribe Streaming API** (not placeholders)
- macOS capture application is fully functional with real audio capture
- Web client application is the main missing piece for end-to-end functionality
