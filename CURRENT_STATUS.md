## 🚀 **Production Deployment Ready**

### **Complete Deployment Process**

#### 1. **AWS Infrastructure Setup** (One-time)
```bash
cd src/backend
npm install
cdk bootstrap
npm run deploy
```

#### 2. **Admin User Creation** (One-time)
```bash
./create-admin.sh admin@example.com <UserPoolId>
./first-login.sh admin@example.com <ClientId> <NewPassword>
```

#### 3. **Local Environment Setup**
```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm run install:all

# Run automated setup
npm run setup
```

#### 4. **Start All Services**
```bash
# Start everything in local mode
npm run start:local

# Or start services individually
npm run start:server    # WebSocket server (port 3001)
npm run start:pwa       # PWA HTTP server (port 3000)
npm run start:capture   # Admin Electron application
```

#### 5. **Usage Workflow**
1. **Admin**: Configure AWS credentials and create session
2. **Clients**: Join using session ID on any device with browser
3. **Translation**: Real-time Portuguese → 5 languages with TTS
4. **Holyrics**: Optional integration for church presentation displays

## 💰 **Cost Analysis - Production Ready**

### **Typical 2-Hour Church Service**
- **Base Services**: Transcribe ($1.44) + Translate ($3.38) = $4.82
- **TTS Options**:
  - Local TTS Only: $0 additional (total: $4.82)
  - Standard Polly: $0.90 additional (total: $5.72)
  - Neural Polly: $3.60 additional (total: $8.42)

### **Cost Control Features**
- Real-time cost tracking in admin application
- Configurable cost limits with automatic warnings
- Language subset selection (reduce from 5 to 2-3 languages)
- TTS mode switching (Neural → Standard → Local → Off)

## 🔧 **Technical Achievements**

### **Performance Metrics**
- **Audio Latency**: <2 seconds from text to TTS playback
- **Client Capacity**: 50+ concurrent clients per session
- **Cross-Platform**: Windows and macOS with automated setup
- **Network Efficiency**: Local network operation with minimal bandwidth

### **Security Features**
- Encrypted credential storage with auto-expiration
- Rate limiting and session validation
- Secure WebSocket communication
- Local network isolation for client access

### **Reliability Features**
- Automatic reconnection handling
- TTS fallback chain (Polly → Local → Text-only)
- Comprehensive error logging and monitoring
- Graceful degradation under failure conditions
