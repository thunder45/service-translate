# AWS Pricing Verification

**Date**: October 13, 2025  
**Verified By**: Cline AI Assistant  
**Sources**: Official AWS Pricing Pages

## Summary

All AWS service pricing in the application has been verified against official AWS documentation and is **CORRECT**.

## Service Pricing Details

### 1. Amazon Transcribe
- **Current Implementation**: $0.024 per minute
- **AWS Official**: $0.024 per minute (Standard Batch/Streaming)
- **Status**: ✅ CORRECT
- **Source**: https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/pricing/
- **Note**: Medical transcription is $0.075/minute, but we're using standard transcription

### 2. Amazon Translate
- **Current Implementation**: $15 per 1 million characters
- **AWS Official**: $15 per 1 million characters (Standard Text Translation)
- **Status**: ✅ CORRECT
- **Source**: https://aws.amazon.com/translate/pricing/
- **Note**: This applies to standard text translation, batch translation, and real-time text/HTML translation

### 3. Amazon Polly
- **Current Implementation**: 
  - Standard voices: $4 per 1 million characters
  - Neural voices: $16 per 1 million characters
- **AWS Official**: 
  - Standard voices: $4 per 1 million characters
  - Neural voices: $16 per 1 million characters
- **Status**: ✅ CORRECT
- **Source**: https://aws.amazon.com/polly/pricing/

## Why Translation Costs More Than Polly Standard

It may seem counterintuitive that Amazon Translate ($15/1M chars) costs more than Polly standard voices ($4/1M chars), but this is accurate because:

1. **Translation Complexity**: 
   - Requires understanding context, grammar, idioms, and cultural nuances
   - Maintains meaning across languages with different structures
   - Uses sophisticated neural machine translation models
   - More computationally intensive AI processing

2. **Polly Standard**:
   - Simpler concatenative synthesis technology
   - No semantic understanding required
   - Pre-built voice models
   - Less computational overhead

3. **Polly Neural**:
   - Most expensive ($16/1M) due to real-time neural network inference
   - Generates more natural-sounding speech with better prosody
   - Higher quality but more resource-intensive than standard

## Cost Comparison Example

For processing 1 million characters of text:
- **Transcribe**: ~694 hours of audio @ $0.024/min = $1,000+ (based on avg speaking rate of 150 words/min)
- **Translate**: $15.00
- **Polly Standard**: $4.00
- **Polly Neural**: $16.00

In a typical usage pattern (translate once, then synthesize speech):
- **Translation + Standard Voice**: $19.00 per 1M characters
- **Translation + Neural Voice**: $31.00 per 1M characters

## Why These Prices Make Sense

### Translation is More Expensive Because:
- **Semantic Analysis**: Understanding meaning, not just words
- **Context Preservation**: Maintaining intent across language barriers
- **Grammar Transformation**: Restructuring sentences for target language rules
- **Cultural Adaptation**: Handling idioms, expressions, and cultural references
- **Bidirectional Models**: Complex neural networks for 75+ language pairs

### Polly Standard is Cheaper Because:
- **Simpler Technology**: Concatenative synthesis or parametric TTS
- **No Understanding**: Just converts phonemes to audio
- **Pre-trained Models**: One-time training per voice
- **Lower Compute**: Less real-time processing required

### Polly Neural is Most Expensive Because:
- **Real-time Neural Synthesis**: Complex deep learning inference per request
- **Prosody Generation**: Natural speech patterns, intonation, rhythm
- **Context-aware**: Better handling of punctuation and emphasis
- **High Quality**: Requires more computational resources

## Implementation Locations

### Frontend (Capture App)
**File**: `src/capture/index.html` (lines 1610-1640)
```javascript
function trackTranscribeUsage(minutes) {
    costTracker.transcribe.minutes += minutes;
    costTracker.transcribe.cost += minutes * 0.024; // $0.024 per minute ✅
    updateTotalCost();
}

function trackTranslateUsage(characters) {
    costTracker.translate.characters += characters;
    costTracker.translate.cost += characters * (15 / 1000000); // $15 per 1M characters ✅
    updateTotalCost();
}

function trackPollyUsage(characters, voiceType) {
    costTracker.polly.characters += characters;
    const rate = voiceType === 'neural' ? (16 / 1000000) : (4 / 1000000); // ✅
    costTracker.polly.cost += characters * rate;
    updateTotalCost();
}
```

### Backend (WebSocket Server)
**File**: `src/websocket-server/src/tts-service.ts` (lines 46-48)
```typescript
private static readonly POLLY_PRICING = {
  standard: 4 / 1000000,  // ✅
  neural: 16 / 1000000    // ✅
};
```

## Free Tier Information

### Transcribe
- 60 minutes per month for 12 months (Free Tier)

### Translate
- 2 million characters per month for 12 months (Free Tier)

### Polly
- Standard: 5 million characters per month for 12 months (Free Tier)
- Neural: 1 million characters per month for 12 months (Free Tier)

## Conclusion

All pricing in the application is accurate and matches AWS official pricing as of October 2025. The apparent discrepancy where Translation ($15/1M) costs more than Polly Standard ($4/1M) is correct and reflects the higher computational complexity of language translation compared to basic text-to-speech synthesis.

**No changes are needed to the cost tracking implementation.**
