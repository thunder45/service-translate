# Session Management Cognito Integration Verification

## Overview

This document verifies that session management has been successfully updated to work with Cognito-based admin identities as specified in Task 9 of the unified admin authentication spec.

## Requirements Verification

### Requirement 4.1: Session Linked to Cognito User ID

**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED

**Evidence:**
- `SessionData` interface includes `adminId: string` field
- Session creation in `message-router.ts` (line 632) uses `adminIdentity.adminId` which is the Cognito sub (UUID)
- Test verification shows sessions are created with Cognito sub as adminId

**Code Reference:**
```typescript
// src/shared/types.ts
export interface SessionData {
  sessionId: string;
  adminId: string;                    // Persistent admin owner (Cognito sub)
  currentAdminSocketId: string | null; // Current admin connection
  createdBy: string;                  // Username for display
  // ... other fields
}

// src/websocket-server/src/message-router.ts (line 632)
const sessionData = this.sessionManager.createSession(
  sessionId,
  config,
  adminIdentity.adminId,  // Cognito sub (UUID)
  socket.id,
  adminIdentity.cognitoUsername
);
```

### Requirement 4.2: Admin Reconnection Regains Session Control

**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED

**Evidence:**
- `SessionManager.updateCurrentAdminSocket()` method allows updating the current admin socket
- Admin identity manager supports multiple socket connections per admin
- Test verification shows sessions are preserved when admin re-authenticates with new socket

**Code Reference:**
```typescript
// src/websocket-server/src/session-manager.ts
updateCurrentAdminSocket(sessionId: string, adminSocketId: string): boolean {
  const session = this.sessions.get(sessionId);
  if (!session) {
    return false;
  }

  session.currentAdminSocketId = adminSocketId;
  session.lastActivity = new Date();
  this.persistSession(session);
  
  console.log(`Updated current admin socket for session: ${sessionId}`);
  return true;
}
```

### Requirement 4.3: Cognito Identity Used for Both AWS and WebSocket

**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED

**Evidence:**
- Admin identity manager uses Cognito sub as the primary identifier
- Session ownership is tracked using Cognito sub
- `createdBy` field uses Cognito username or email for display

**Code Reference:**
```typescript
// src/websocket-server/src/admin-identity-manager.ts
public async authenticateWithCredentials(
  username: string,
  password: string,
  socketId: string
): Promise<{
  adminId: string;  // Cognito sub
  cognitoTokens: CognitoTokens;
  ownedSessions: string[];
}> {
  const authResult: CognitoAuthResult = await this.cognitoAuth.authenticateUser(username, password);
  
  // Get or create admin identity using Cognito sub as adminId
  let identity = this.store.getAdminIdentity(authResult.userInfo.sub);
  // ...
}
```

### Requirement 6.5: Sessions Preserved After Token Expiry

**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED

**Evidence:**
- Sessions are persisted to disk with adminId (Cognito sub)
- Session ownership is tracked independently of socket connections
- Admin can re-authenticate and regain access to their sessions
- Test verification shows sessions remain accessible after re-authentication

**Code Reference:**
```typescript
// src/websocket-server/src/session-manager.ts
verifyAdminAccess(sessionId: string, adminId: string, operation: 'read' | 'write'): boolean {
  const session = this.sessions.get(sessionId);
  if (!session) {
    return false;
  }

  // Read access: all admins can view all sessions
  if (operation === 'read') {
    return true;
  }

  // Write access: only the session owner can modify
  if (operation === 'write') {
    return session.adminId === adminId;  // Uses Cognito sub
  }

  return false;
}
```

## Test Results

All tests passed successfully:

```
=== All Tests Passed ✓ ===

Summary:
✓ SessionData uses adminId field (Cognito-compatible)
✓ Session creation uses Cognito sub as adminId
✓ createdBy field uses Cognito username or email
✓ Session persistence works with Cognito-based IDs
✓ Sessions are preserved when admin re-authenticates after token expiry
```

### Test Coverage

1. **Test 1: SessionData Structure**
   - Verified `adminId` field exists and is set to Cognito sub
   - Verified adminId is in UUID format (Cognito sub format)

2. **Test 2: Session Creation**
   - Verified sessions are created with Cognito sub as adminId
   - Verified adminId matches expected Cognito sub value

3. **Test 3: createdBy Field**
   - Verified `createdBy` field uses Cognito username
   - Verified value is set correctly during session creation

4. **Test 4: Session Persistence**
   - Verified sessions are persisted to disk with Cognito-based IDs
   - Verified sessions can be loaded after server restart
   - Verified adminId and createdBy are preserved

5. **Test 5: Session Preservation on Re-authentication**
   - Verified sessions remain owned by same admin after token expiry
   - Verified currentAdminSocketId can be updated for reconnection
   - Verified admin can still access their sessions after re-authentication
   - Verified session ownership is maintained

## Implementation Details

### Session Data Structure

The `SessionData` interface has been designed to support Cognito-based authentication:

- **adminId**: Persistent admin owner identifier (Cognito sub UUID)
- **currentAdminSocketId**: Current WebSocket connection (can change on reconnection)
- **createdBy**: Display name (Cognito username or email)

This separation allows:
- Sessions to persist across admin reconnections
- Multiple socket connections per admin
- Clear ownership tracking using Cognito identity

### Session Creation Flow

1. Admin authenticates with Cognito credentials
2. Admin identity manager creates/retrieves admin identity using Cognito sub
3. Session is created with:
   - `adminId`: Cognito sub (UUID)
   - `currentAdminSocketId`: Current socket connection
   - `createdBy`: Cognito username or email
4. Session is persisted to disk
5. Session ID is added to admin's owned sessions

### Re-authentication Flow

1. Admin's access token expires
2. Admin re-authenticates with Cognito (credentials or refresh token)
3. Admin identity manager validates Cognito token
4. Admin identity is retrieved using Cognito sub
5. New socket connection is added to admin's active sockets
6. Admin regains access to all owned sessions
7. Session's `currentAdminSocketId` can be updated if needed

### Session Persistence

Sessions are persisted to disk in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sessionId": "CHURCH-2025-001",
  "adminId": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
  "currentAdminSocketId": "socket-123",
  "createdBy": "admin@example.com",
  "config": { ... },
  "clients": [ ... ],
  "createdAt": "2025-10-09T...",
  "lastActivity": "2025-10-09T...",
  "status": "started"
}
```

The `adminId` field uses the Cognito sub (UUID), ensuring:
- Consistent identity across server restarts
- No dependency on socket connections
- Compatibility with Cognito authentication

## Migration Notes

### Backward Compatibility

The session manager includes migration logic for old session files:

```typescript
migrateOldSessionFiles(): void {
  // Converts old adminSocketId to adminId and currentAdminSocketId
  // Old sessions are assigned to 'system' admin
}
```

This ensures existing sessions can be loaded, though they will be owned by a system admin rather than a specific Cognito user.

### Breaking Changes

This implementation is part of the unified admin authentication breaking change (v2.0.0):
- Old sessions created before Cognito integration will be migrated to system ownership
- Admins must re-authenticate with Cognito credentials
- New sessions will be properly linked to Cognito identities

## Conclusion

All requirements for Task 9 have been successfully implemented and verified:

1. ✅ SessionData uses adminId field (Cognito-compatible)
2. ✅ Session creation uses Cognito sub as adminId
3. ✅ createdBy field uses Cognito username or email
4. ✅ Session persistence works with Cognito-based IDs
5. ✅ Sessions are preserved when admin re-authenticates after token expiry

The session management system is now fully integrated with Cognito-based authentication and supports:
- Persistent admin identities using Cognito sub
- Session ownership tracking across reconnections
- Multiple socket connections per admin
- Session preservation after token expiry and re-authentication

## Next Steps

With Task 9 complete, the remaining tasks in the unified admin authentication spec are:

- Task 10: Create unified setup script
- Task 11: Update deployment and startup scripts
- Task 12: Update documentation

These tasks focus on setup, deployment, and documentation rather than core functionality.
